# Smart-Stove-Monitor
Smart Stove Monitor is a real-time safety system that uses a laptop camera and computer vision to detect if your gas stove is left on. It instantly alerts your phone with a vibration and alarm the moment you leave home — and also warns you if no one has been near the stove for more than 10 minutes.
